# Getting Started with Create React App

This is the project from the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) crash course. It includes the react ui as well as JSON-server for our mock backend

## Usage

In the project directory, install dependencies:

### `npm install`

Run React dev server [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm start`

## Run JSON server [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
